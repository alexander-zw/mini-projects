# CS 70 Helper

This folder contains code that implements stuff from the course CS 70. It started as a custom calculator I used to do homework, but it has grown to include demonstrations of concepts and simulators of algorithms. It can be used to make tedious calculations, e.g. to verify homework problems (modular arithmetic), or to make simulations to verify proofs (stable marriage). It can also be used in class to demonstrate applications of concept (RSA, Monty Hall).
