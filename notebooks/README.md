This repo contains most of the projects that are IPython Notebooks. They are mostly visualizations.

`lorentz_transform` constains visualizations for Lorentz transformations in special relativity using spacetime diagrams.

`wavefunction_visualizer` contains functions for visualizing any quantum wavefunction using 2D and 3D animations.

`random_checker` contains functions that can help check whether a bit string is random.
