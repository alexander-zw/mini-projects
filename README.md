# mini-projects

This repo contains some small projects I've done over time.

`useful_tools` programs that may be useful in various situations, mostly
in Python. In particular, it contains programs for renaming and converting
files in bulk.

`miscellaneous_java` contains various projects in Java. They were grouped
into one folder because Java requires specific file structures.

`notebooks` contains iPython notebooks that are mostly demos that I find
useful.

`teaching` contains some code I wrote while teaching computer science.

Note: The folder `cs70helper` has been moved to its own repository,
[cs70_helper](https://github.com/alexander-zw/cs70_helper).
